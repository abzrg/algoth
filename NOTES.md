For problems involving data structures that are difficult to build by hand, I may start by reading the input. Otherwise, I tend to save that code for last. The reason for this is that we can generally test the functions we’re writing by calling them with sample values; there is no need to worry about parsing the input until we’re ready to solve the whole problem. -- algorithmic thinking book
